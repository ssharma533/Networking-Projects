Description of Project1

Project Title: Network Setup with Aruba 6300 Switch
Overview:
This project showcases a simple network setup using an Aruba 6300 Switch. The network includes two PCs configured with distinct VLANs and IP addresses within the 172.16.10.128/26 subnet. This setup serves as a foundational example for network segmentation and basic configuration using Aruba networking equipment.

Features:
Aruba 6300 Switch Integration:
Central switch providing connectivity and management for the network.
VLAN Configuration:
VLAN 42: Assigned to PC1 with IP 172.16.10.129/26.
VLAN 34: Assigned to PC2 with IP 172.16.10.130/26.

IP Addressing Scheme:
Utilizes the IP range 172.16.10.128 - 172.16.10.191 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 (/26).

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic network setup using Aruba networking equipment, specifically the Aruba 6300 Switch. It serves as a learning resource for those interested in network segmentation, VLAN configuration, and IP addressing schemes.
